# AA 260 Lab 5

**Assignment:**

Part 1
You decide that your house needs a new water heater. Your previous water heater was electric,
had an efficiency of 92%, and cost $423 a year to operate when electricity cost $0.13/kWh. One
option is to replace it with a the same unit. The other option is to buy a heat pump powered
water heater that has a COP of 3.3, but costs about $1000 more (for both the actual unit and
installation). Determine how many years it will take for the heat pump water heater to pay for its
cost differential from the energy it saves.

Part 2
Investigate the effect of the COP on the payback period for the heat pump option. Plot the paybak
period vs COP for values between 2 and 5, and discuss the results.
When you are all done, you can check with your TA for feedback before submitting the final
report.
Have fun!
